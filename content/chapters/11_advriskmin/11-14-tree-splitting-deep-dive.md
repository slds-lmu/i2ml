weight: 11014
---
Learn how minimizing Bernoulli (log) loss yields entropy‐based splits and minimizing the Brier score yields Gini‐based splits, unifying impurity and risk views for optimal tree splitting. This section is presented as a **deep-dive**. Please note that there are no videos accompanying this section.
